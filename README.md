# READ THIS FIRST
As there aren't many documentation on the GJP (Geometry Jump Password) and GDBrowser has switched to using ordinary passwords instead, this repository no longer serves a purpose and is now archived.
# What GJP is
It's just a multi-level weak encryption made by the creator of Geometry Dash, RobTop. The result will then be used primarily for fetching the level leaderboards.
# How to use this
Easy. Just type your GD password onto the form and there you go! The output will be generated below the form.
# Credits
The XOR Cipher and part of the main code was ripped off from https://github.com/Cvolton/GMDprivateServer
